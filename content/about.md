Welcome to my resume website. I am an enthusiast engineer, who enjoys building, testing and most important... DEPLOYING! 

I am originally from London, and I chose my path to be an engineer mainly because I like to fix and building things that are based in computing and software. 

My path started as a Junior IT Support, answering calls and helping internal associates fix their issues to their PC and be able to setup accounts and laptops for new starters, getting involved with internal projects and so on. 
I have pursued my career in different industries: 
* Building Architecture
* Trading - Oil and Gas
* Financial Technology (FinTech)

In the early days, when AWS was getting popular, I was building my interest toward AWS Cloud and getting to learn more to it. After it's peak and more tech giants joined the Cloud market, I detected this will be a problem for many engineers, having to understand the services and the gui setup for each provider. 

As the market expands, there is a great majority of cloud native tools to use that are supported in any cloud host provider. Each one tool has a role, which overtime, makes it easier for any engineer manage their infrastructure in using the below tools: 
* Infrastructure-as-a-Code -> Terraform
* Containerasation -> Docker and Kubernetes
* Deployment Implementation -> Ansible
* Securty -> PrismaCloud
* SAST Scanning -> CheckMarx, GitLab SAST
* DAST Scanning -> BlackDuck, GitLab DAST
