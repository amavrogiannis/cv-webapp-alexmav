      <description>Welcome to my resume website. I am an enthusiast engineer, who enjoys building. As you might see, this website is hosted using the following technology stack.
It makes use of a variety of open source projects including:
 Hosting this website using AWS:  Route 53 CloudFront S3 Bucket Certificate Manager   CI/CD Pipeline method:  Terraform GitHub Actions   Website Framework:  Hugo Template    Here is a link to my GitHub.</description>

      <description>As you can see the operation for this website, is fast, secure and reliable. The structure was simple, which I use Hugo configuration to apply my changes and then Huogo takes over in loading the template and make it look nice.
The stack behind the scenes, is AWS. In this stage, the site is hosted via AWS S3 Static hosting but the complicated part comes from the CI/CD pipeline being set up.</description>
