<p>The stack behind the scenes, is AWS. In this stage, the site is hosted via AWS S3 Static hosting but the complicated part comes from the CI/CD pipeline being set up.</p>
<p>What is the saving cost, by automating it?</p>
<p>Lets overview it by giving an example how its done manually:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create GitHub repo with a config file, then clone remote the theme repo.</li>
<li>Configure the website as you want, adding the content and making changes.</li>
<li>Test the website deploying it to your localhost.</li>
<li>Export the website to HTML and then upload the HTML files on AWS S3.
<ul>
<li>AWS S3 bucket and CloudFront is configured before hand. Change will apply when uploading the content.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Then the CloudFront will pickup the new HTML files uploaded to s3 and you will get deployed to the world wide web (www).</li>
</ul>
<p>How does automation simplifies the process, and saves time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clone repository, create the config file and apply your changes.</li>
<li>Upload your config file changes on GitHub.</li>
<li>CI/CD (GitHub Actions) YAML specifies the above steps:
<ul>
<li>Checkout code</li>
<li>Build the website with Hugo plugin (marketplace)</li>
<li>Export and zip html files and upload to artifacts</li>
<li>Pull the zip folder artifacts and export the files and sync them to S3</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
